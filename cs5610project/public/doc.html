			In this project, I developed a web application which can help users to
			search for movies, look up top rated movies, movies now playing, and 
			help user to remember those movies he/she likes. Also, user can like 
			other users and view their favorite movies. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The technology I used is MEAN stack, hosted on the OpenShift cloud, 
			and the movie data fetched through the 
			<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target="_blank">TMDb API</a>.
