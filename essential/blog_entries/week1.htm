<p>
    In the HTML5 Semantic Elements experiment, I've tried some of the new semantic elements in HTML5, which I will be using in my project.
</p>

<p>
    The HTML5 Drag and Drop experiment implemented ordering paragraphs by using the drap and drop features of HTML5. I will be using those features in my project, to manipulate the objects.
</p>

<p>
    I've also experimented video features of HTML5, tried both the local video and YouTube video. My project might include some youtube videos.
</p>

<p>
    In the CSS Page Layout experiment, I implemented multiple columns page layout using float. I may use the Bootstrap framework in my project.
</p>

<p>
    In the Responsive Design experiment, I made my page layout be resposible to different screen size: laptop/desktop, tablet and phone. I first used the grid system to create the page layout. Then the resposive page acts as:<br />
    - Laptop/Desktop Display: The biggest screen, everything can be shown. <br />
    - Tablet Display: The medium screen, everything can still be shown, in relative smaller size. <br />
    - Phone Display: The smallest screen, the left-side navigation area will hide, and a small dropdown navigation area will be created.
