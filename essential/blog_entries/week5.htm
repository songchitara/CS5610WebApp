<h3>
    AngularJS Routing - Basic Route
</h3>
<p>
    This experiment I will implement the basic route between two pages: home.html and favorite.html
</p>

<h3>
    AngularJS Routing - Create Own Services
</h3>
<p>
    Continue to the previous experiment, in this expriement I will create our own MovieService.
</p>


<h3>
    AngularJS Routing - Communicate Between Controllers
</h3>
<p>
    In the previous experiment, we created our own MovieService, in this experiment, we will take use of that singleton object to fulfill communicating between controllers.
</p>


<h3>
    AngularJS Routing - Login/Logout
</h3>
<p>
    In this experiment, I'll implement the login/logout feature for my angularjs routing page. After success login, the name of the user will appear at the top-right of the page and the role of the user will be shown in the parenthesis.
</p>


<h3>
    AngularJS Routing - Profiles
</h3>
<p>
    In this experiment, I will diplay the different profiles based on different role types. The admin can view all users, their roles, related courses, and all courses. The faculty can view the courses he/she is teaching, the student can view the courses he/she has registered.
