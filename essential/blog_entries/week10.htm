<h3>
    Project Related: Relationship Visualization
</h3>
<p>
    It is always a good idea to visualize things. In this experiment, I will use the CytoscapeJS to create a nice visualized JSON relationships. Later I will use this in my project to visualize the relations and connections among users.
</p>

<h3>
    Project Related: Relationship Visualization with Images
</h3>
<p>
    In this experiement, I will use another type of graph in CytoscapeJS which can specify our own image as the graph nodes. This is very helpful to my project that render the movies and user relationships with the movie posters as the graph node.
</p>

<h3>
    Project Related: Google Map API
</h3>
<p>
    In this experiement, I will use the google map api to mark favorite place. Later in the project, a favorite theater could be shared in through map among users.
</p>

<h3>
    Project Related: Google Map API Geolocation
</h3>
<p>
    When using google map, one of the best features is that the google can locate your current position in the map. In this experiment, we are going to implement this geolocation feature.
</p>

<h3>
    Project Related: Calendar and Events
</h3>
<p>
    Calendar is quite useful for displaying events. In this experiment, I will use the FullCalendar to create a calendar and customize the events. Later in my project, I could add the event/movie show into the Calendar and displaying in the home page.
