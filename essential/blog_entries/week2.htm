    As in the last week, I implemented sorting paragraphs/objects by using HTML5 drag and drop features, however, 
    it needs a temporary area for holding the temp paragraph.  This time, in the jQuery Sortable experiment I took 
    advantages of the jQuery library to make paragraphs directly sortable without any temp areas. I will be using 
    this directly sorting features i  my project to rearrange the order of objects.
</p>

<p>
    Even though I implemented directly sorting paragraphs in the previous experiement, if the paragraphs are long or
    too many, it will be inconvenient to drag one paragraph and place it to another place.  
    So in this jQuery Hide and Show experiment,  I'm using the jQuery slide show and hide features, so that we can first 
    hide the content of the paragraphs, then just drag the titles, and after reordering done, show the content of 
    the paragraphs.
</p>

    I also had serveral experiments on the Bootstrap slider. First, in the Bootstrap Slider experiment, I used the Bootstrap Carousel 
    to implement a slider, which can auto rendering and sliding the slides. Also, we can click the right or left arrow to manually
    navigate the slides, and further we can click the small circles in the bottom to jump to any slide. I will built the slider for 
    my project.
</p>

<p>
    The slider I've created somehow rendering the image wierd because it stretched the image. So in the Bootstrap Slider Image Scale
    experiment, I solved that problem by scaling down the size of image so that it fits entirely into the slider.
</p>

<p>
    After I've scaled down the image, the details of the image may not clear to see. So in this Bootstrap Slider Lightbox Toggle
    experiment, I implement a feature that when you click on the image withn the slider, the image "pops out" and enlarged, when 
    you click the area outside the enlarged image, it got disappeared. I can put this improved slider into my project (or I'll add
    more features once I've explored more on jQuery and Bootstrap).
