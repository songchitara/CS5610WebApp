<h3>
    More on Passport - Hide Unnecessary Links
</h3>
<p>
    It will be very odd is someone has logged in but there are still links like "Login" and "Registeration". The even worse part is when click on these links after being logged in, the behavior of the app will be very weird. So in this experiment, I will hide the "Login" and "Registeration" links when user has logged in. After the user logout, the two links will resume.

<h3>
    More on Passport - Dynamic Password Validation
</h3>
<p>
    When a user want to sign up for a new account, in the web page it usually requires to type the password twice to make sure the user do not have the typos in their password. It is always a good idea that the web page dynamically shows if the second time the user is typing the password the same as the first time. So in this experiment, I will implement the dynamic password validation.

<h3>
    More on Passport - Admin User
</h3>
<p>
    The admin user will always have the highest permission, and we can use the admin user to view all other users as well as their informations. This will be very handy for us to debug or view our data.

<h3>
    More on Passport - Form Validation
</h3>
<p>
    When register a new user, there are rules to follow such as the username should neither be too short nor too long. In this experiment, I will dynamically validate the username field in the register form, when the length of username does not meet our standard, a message field will appear to let the user know.
</p>

<h3>
    More on Passport - Existing Check
</h3>
<p>
    In the last week's experiment, I implemented the simple registeration page, however, I didn't handle the case when the user already exists. In this experiment, I will improve the registration page by checking if the user has already registered, if so, do not register it.
